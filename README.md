# binarysearch-FPGA
This is an implementation of the Binary Search Algorithm coded in System Verilog to run on an FPGA board. The code is organized via a top level module of the algorithm, followed by a control-unit module for the FSM logic and a datapath module for operations and arithmetic on registers.
